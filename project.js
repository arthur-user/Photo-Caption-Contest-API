When you're using Sequelize with the `sequelize-cli` package, you're not just manually writing the model files inside the `models` folder; you're actually using the command-line tool to generate those files automatically. The `sequelize-cli` helps you set up your models, migrations, and seeders in a standardized way, and it can save a lot of time compared to manually creating them.

Here’s a breakdown of the process:

### 1. **Install `sequelize-cli`**:
If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev sequelize-cli
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```bash
yarn add --dev sequelize-cli
```

### 2. **Initialize the Sequelize project**:
In your project folder, you need to initialize Sequelize, which will create a `config` folder, a `models` folder, and a `migrations` folder (if they don't already exist).

Run the following command:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli init
```

This will create the required folder structure for your project.

### 3. **Create a model using the CLI**:
Once you have the `sequelize-cli` set up, you can generate a model through the command line rather than writing it manually. For example, to create a `User` model with some columns (like `username` and `email`), you’d run:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name User --attributes username:string,email:string
```

This will create:
- A **model file** inside the `models` folder (like `models/user.js`).
- A **migration file** in the `migrations` folder to set up the corresponding table in the database.

### 4. **Edit the Model (Optional)**:
After the model is generated, you can open and edit it in the `models` folder if you want to add any custom methods, validations, associations, etc. However, the core structure (like attributes and data types) will already be set for you.

### 5. **Run Migrations**:
Once you have your models and migrations set up, you need to run the migrations to create the tables in your database.

To run the migrations, use:

```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

This will apply all the migrations and set up the actual tables in your database.

### Why Use the `sequelize-cli`:
- **Consistency**: The CLI helps you maintain a consistent structure for your models, migrations, and seeders.
- **Automatic Setup**: It generates the necessary files and boilerplate code for you.
- **Manage Migrations**: It helps you keep track of changes to your database schema over time.

### Recap:
While you can manually write the models in the `models` folder, it's much easier and cleaner to use the `sequelize-cli` to generate them, especially if you're dealing with migrations or need to keep your schema changes in version control. The CLI automates much of the setup and can help you stay organized.
